I’m an MRes student in Synthetic Biology at University College London (UCL). My current research focuses on RNA therapeutics production. I’m also well-equipped with sort of bioinformatics skillsets. I’ve spent many hours on the lab bench and in front of my computer.

Prior to UCL, I was working as an R&D Upstream Process at Etana Biotech, focusing on large-scale manufacturing for mRNA vaccine against COVID-19. I’m also building a small biotech startup called Nusazyme which focuses on enzyme engineering and production in Indonesia.
